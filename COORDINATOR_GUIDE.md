## 🚀 Advanced Tactics

### **Tactic 1: QR Code at Provincial Meeting**

1. Download QR code
2. Insert into PowerPoint slide
3. Display full-screen during presentation
4. Give 5 minutes for enrollment
5. Walk around to assist

**Script:**
> "Please take out your phones. Open your camera and point it at this QR code. When the link appears, tap it. You'll see the enrollment form already filled out with this training's details. Just enter your Teacher ID and phone number, then submit. It takes 30 seconds. I'll wait while you do this now."

**Expected Results:** 60-80% immediate enrollment

### **Tactic 2: SMS + WhatsApp Combo**

**Day 1:** Send SMS with link
**Day 2:** Post QR code in WhatsApp group
**Day 5:** Send reminder SMS

**Why it works:**
- SMS reaches everyone (even without WhatsApp)
- WhatsApp provides visual QR code
- Reminder catches procrastinators

### **Tactic 3: School Visit with Tablet**

For schools with limited internet:
1. Bring tablet with 4G/5G
2. Show QR code on tablet screen
3. Teachers scan with their phones
4. Or use tablet to enroll them directly

**Efficiency:** Enroll 10-15 teachers in 30 minutes

## ❓ Common Questions & Answers

### **Q: Teachers don't have smartphones. What do I do?**

**A:** Use one of these methods:
1. **Coordinator-assisted enrollment:** Use your phone/tablet, have teacher dictate their ID and phone
2. **Computer at school:** Open link on school computer
3. **Paper form + manual entry:** Last resort - collect info, enter later

### **Q: How do I know if my link/QR code is working?**

**A:** Test it yourself:
1. Scan the QR code with your phone
2. Check that training details appear correctly
3. Don't submit (unless testing enrollment)

### **Q: Can teachers enroll in multiple trainings at once?**

**A:** Yes! They can:
1. Use QR/link for first training (fastest)

3. Or you can share multiple QR codes

**Note:** System will detect schedule conflicts and warn them

### **Q: What if training fills up?**

**A:**
1. System will stop accepting enrollments at max capacity
